They will be assessed against the residential development provisions through the building permit process.\nPlease note that changes to the provisions in clause 54 will come into effect on 8 September 2025. You can view the changes and find out more at Stronger standards and faster approvals for single homes and small second homes.\n## Objectives and standards\n### Objectives\nAn objective describes the desired outcome in the completed development. A development must meet all the objectives of clause 54 that apply to the application.\nThe objectives aim to achieve residential development that:\n- respects neighbourhood character\n- protects amenity\n- is sustainable.\nYou can’t \"trade off\" between objectives.\nCouncil must consider the associated standard and decision guidelines when they decide if the development meets each objective.\n### Standards\nEach objective contains a standard. A standard contains the requirements to meet the objective.\nStandards should normally be met. However, if the council is satisfied that an application for an alternative design solution meets the objective, the alternative may be considered.\nCouncil can vary some of the standards in clause 54 by using a schedule to a residential zone or a schedule to a Neighbourhood Character Overlay.\nIf a development meets standard A3, A4, A5, A6, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17 or A20, it is deemed to meet the objective for that standard.\nWhere standard A3, A4, A5, A6, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17 or A20 is met the decision guidelines for that standard do not apply to the application.\n### Decision guidelines\nDecision guidelines set out the matters the council must consider before deciding if an application meets the objectives.\nMost objectives of clause 54 have decision guidelines.\nThe decision guidelines help council to decide if:\n- the objective will be met if the standard is met\n- the objective will be met if an alternative design solution is used\nCouncil can add local decision guidelines using a schedule to a residential zone.\nCouncil doesn’t need to document its consideration of each individual decision guideline. A general statement that council has considered all of the objectives and decision guidelines in the report on the application will usually be sufficient after a merits assessment.\n## Planning practice notes\nThe following practice notes help to explain the residential development provisions and remain applicable to a residential application made under clause 54:\n- PPN15: Assessing an application for one or more dwellings in a residential zone\n- PPN16: Making an application for one or more dwellings in a residential zone\n- PPN27: Understanding the residential development standards (ResCode)\n## Building permits and single dwellings\nThe development of a dwelling will require a building permit.\nPage last updated: 11/08/25",
